                        We integrated Google Analytics (with anonymisation function) on this website. Google Analytics
                        is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the gathering, collection and analysis of data about
                        the behavior of visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service collects data
                        on which website a data subject has come to a website from (so-called referrers), which subpages
                        of the website were accessed or how often and for which period of time a subpage was viewed. A
                        web analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the cost-benefit analysis of Internet
                        advertising. The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre

                        in agreement with the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is
                        sent to and shortened by a Google server in the USA. On behalf of the operator of the website,
                        Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compile reports on website
                        activity and to provide further services related to website and internet use to us. The IP
                        address transferred through your browser to Google Analytics will not be combined with other
                        data held by Google. In addition, this website uses the Analytics feature UserID to track

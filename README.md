# 🔥 Fireside - Twilio Hackathon
Welcome to Fireside, a project inspired by the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) Hackthon on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/). 👨‍💻

You can find the app [here](https://fireside.netlify.app/)

## About Fireside
Fireside connects strangers via phone calls based on common interests. As boredom, loneliness and social isolation have risen during these trying times, we thought a good, old-fashioned phone call could be a good distraction.

To make it more fun you can try to guess those common interests after the call to gather "sparks". That way you have a goal that can act as a talking point should it ever feel awkward (it probably will 😉).

Tl;dr:

😊 Have fun
⏺ Step outside your comfort zone
👫 Make friends

## How to run
### Frontend
Change into the `frontend` folder and run `npm install`.

After that adjust the `.env.development` to your needs and run `npm run serve`.

### Backend
Change into the `backend` folder and run `npm install`.

I suggest installing concurrently globally with `npm i -g concurrently`.
After that run `npm run watch` to reload changes during development.
